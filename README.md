##### Automatic modulation classification (AMC) refers to a signal processing mechanism through which the intercepted signal’s modulation scheme can be classified with minimal information on the signal’s configurations. 
##### This process is exclusively operated at the receiver side of a communication.

### To run the AWC you just need to provide a folder that contains test and train data and run the following command:


```bash
 python3 AWC_Classifier.py INPUT_DIRECTORY
 ```
